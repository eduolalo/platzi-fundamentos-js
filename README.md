Template for Google IDX and Bun

I've made this for my Platzi JS courses to study even using a browser and
using Google IDX I can access to Gemini IA for free.

I use Bun instead Node, if you prefer another engine, you can fork my template and configure it as you wish.

This template has configured this extensions:

* code-spell-checker-spanish
* code-spell-checker
* shades-of-purple
* atom-keybindings
* code-runner
* prettier-vscode
* errorlens
* bun-vscode
